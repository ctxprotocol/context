 * Community Skills Registry

 * This file acts as the central registry for all community-submitted skills.
 * When you add a new skill file (e.g., `uniswap.ts`), you MUST export it here
 * so the AI agent can find and use it.
 *
 * Example:
 * export * as uniswap from "./uniswap";
 * export * as myCoolSkill from "./my-cool-skill";
